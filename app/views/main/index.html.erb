                <p>EARLY 2012</p>
                <p>
                    Amy &amp; Kevin (mostly Kevin) first laid eyes on one another at a pool hall in
                    San Diego.  With the stentch of pool room in the air, Kevin had never seen such
                    natural beauty. Unfortunately, Amy would prove to be a tad…elusive…on the road
                    to a dating relationship.

                <p>
                    With Amy joining Kevin's old pool team and developing mutual friends, Amy &amp;
                    Kevin began hanging out and socializing on a regular basis which was the
                    foundation of their friendship and would later lead to an extraodinary love.

                <p>
                    After a year or so of friendship, Kevin finally got the woman he had been
                    searching for his entire life. Amy finally found a happiness that she
                    deserved more than anyone.  Kevin went to England shortly afterwards and
                    spent the entire trip keeping an American time schedule so they could
                    Skype and sleep beside each other.

                    Only 6 months into their relationship Amy &amp; Kevin couldn't hide their
                    love from each other and on a drunken night out watching UFC Amy told Kevin
                    she wanted to marry him. Kevin said "you're drunk, if you remember this
                    tomorrow we'll go and get you a ring". The first thing Kevin heard in the
                    morning was Amy's gentle voice saying "I still want to marry you".

                    Amy &amp; Kevin had decided to have a long engagement to allow family and
                    friends to save money to attend the wedding.  The wedding was scheduled
                    for August 2015, but a little surprise was awaiting them. While ordering
                    dinner at Thai House with Ricky &amp; Ysabelle, Amy started to feel nautious.
                    That night Kevin ran to get a pregnancy test and our very own family had begun.

                    Emma Kylie May arrived on the 5th of July, 2015. A day that neither Amy or
                    Kevin will ever forget. The whole pregnancy process brought Amy &amp; Kevin
                    even closer together. Since being born Emma has challenged Amy &amp; Kevin
                    in every way imaginable, but together they have been strong and have provided
                    a solid, stable environment for Emma to develop and become the social
                    butterfly that she is. Emma has been a blessing and every smile melts our hearts.

                    Having experienced almost all the life events you can as a couple from buying
                    a house to having a baby Amy &amp; Kevin's love for each other is still
                    undeniable. They now know they can take on life's challenges as a team
                    and overcome them, forever making their relationship stronger. So what started
                    off as a seemingly quick decision, proved to be the right decision driven by
                    pure hearts.
